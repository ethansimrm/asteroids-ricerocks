# asteroids-ricerocks

This was my implementation of Asteroids - the culmination of An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, a Coursera course organised by Rice University.

I've tried to get it working in IDLE, but it's remarkably less responsive (and functional) compared to the browser-based IDE (CodeSkulptor).

I've included my code here just as a mirror, but do try it out in CodeSkulptor itself - https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_EPoytZ0ZYFsLROi_0.py

Use the arrow keys to move, and the space bar to shoot.
